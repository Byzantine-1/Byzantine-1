# 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua Nagle (@Byzantine-1)

I’m a **B.S. Computer Science graduate** and hands-on builder focused on **practical AI**, **durable systems**, and **mobile-first tools** that work in the real world (offline, noisy inputs, high feedback loops).

- 🧠 I like shipping systems that are **deterministic, testable, and replay-safe**
- 🛠️ Interests: **agent workflows**, **LLM integrations**, **automation**, **field tech**, **simulation engines**
- 📍 Based in the U.S.

## 🚀 Featured Work (Public)

### 🧱 Minecraft God / World Engine (Simulation + Systems)
I’m building a replay-safe “world engine” that can drive a living simulation: **economy, quests, factions, news/chronicle, and nightly threat loops**—designed to scale and remain deterministic under stress.

**What’s interesting about it:**
- Transactional mutations + **eventId idempotency** (replay-safe outcomes)
- Durable world features: markers, jobs, markets/trades, town board, quests
- Stress validation with invariants (integrity checks, lock timeout monitoring)

**Repos to check:**
- `MineCraftGodWorld`
- `MinecraftGodMVP-blackbox` (stress + invariants)

### 🧪 Systems & Utilities
A grab-bag of practical experiments and tools I iterate on while building larger products.

**Repo to check:**
- `Basic-Referral-System` (referral tracking / incentives foundation)

## 🔒 Private / In Progress (Available on Request)

### 📱 Yondo — AI-Powered Sales Coaching (Private)
A React Native/Expo app for door-to-door reps to **log outcomes fast**, **record conversations**, and receive **AI coaching**.  
*Repo is private for now — I can share a demo or grant read-only access for employers on request.*

## 🧰 Tech I Use
**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, SQL  
**Mobile:** React Native, Expo  
**AI/Agents:** OpenAI API, agent orchestration, prompt engineering  
**Data/DB:** SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB  
**Tooling:** Git/GitHub, Linux, Bash, VS Code, XAMPP/LAMP

## 🌱 Currently Learning / Leveling Up
- Advanced React Native patterns (offline-first, multi-platform UX)
- Reliable agent systems (bounded outputs, deterministic fallbacks)
- Cloud architecture basics (AWS / Firebase / Supabase)

---

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate On
- AI-driven tools with real users and real constraints (field workflows, ops automation)
- Deterministic simulations and replay-safe architectures
- Mobile-first products with strong UX + metrics
