## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 **B.S. in Computer Science**
- 🤖 **Currently building [Yondo](https://github.com/Byzantine-1/yondo):**  
  A React Native/Expo mobile app for door-to-door sales reps—real-time log tracking, audio recording, and **AI-powered instant sales coaching** with OpenAI GPT-4
- 💡 **Past Projects:**  
  - Agentic writing workflow for automated book/story generation (OpenAI API + SQLite + web stack)
  - Deep learning/autoencoder projects for anomaly detection and ML model experimentation
  - Indie game prototyping in Unity and JavaScript (Four in a Row, text-based games)
  - Door-to-door solar and sales process optimization (real-world data meets code!)

- 🛠️ **Tech I Use:**  
  - React Native, Expo, TypeScript, Python
  - OpenAI/LLM API integration, AsyncStorage, REST/GraphQL
  - XAMPP/LAMP, MySQL, MongoDB
  - Linux, VS Code, Git, Bash scripting
